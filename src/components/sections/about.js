            Hello! I'm Omar ðŸ‘‹, a backend engineer specializing in Node.js, though
            I love building with whatever tools are right for the job. I
            graduated with a Computer Science degree from Helwan University in
            2023. My passion for web development began during my senior year
            when I completed my first real-time production project - a one-man
            show where I built both the frontend and backend, while also
            configuring a CentOS server using{" "}
            <a href="https://nginx.org/">Nginx</a>,{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            After graduation ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ“, I had the unique opportunity to continue
            programming during my military service, where I developed a desktop
            military management system using {" "}
            <a href="https://Electronjs.org/">ElectronJS</a>  for the 30-June Air
            Defense Stadium. The system remains in use even after I completed my
            service. These days, my focus is on building accessible, inclusive
            products and digital experiences for various clients.
          </p>

          <p>
          I'm looking for new positions and opportunities where I can merge my love for code. If you think you've got an opening that I might like, let's connect  ðŸ”—
